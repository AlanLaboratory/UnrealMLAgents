UnrealMLAgents documentation
============================

Introduction
------------

This project is my humble adaptation of the exceptional `Unity ML-Agents Toolkit <https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents>`_,
which has set a high standard for game-based machine learning. My goal with this plugin is to bring all the incredible
work and features from Unity's ML-Agents to Unreal Engine. I wanted to give Unreal developers the same powerful tools
and opportunities that Unity developers have enjoyed for years.

The Unity ML-Agents Toolkit is known for its amazing documentation, thoughtful design, and ability to empower
developers to create intelligent agents in virtual environments. By adapting this for Unreal Engine, I hope to open up
those possibilities to Unreal developers, while staying true to the high standards set by Unity.

Unreal Engine and Machine Learning
----------------------------------

Unreal Engine also has its own plugin for machine learning, called
`Unreal Learning Agents <https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/kRm/unreal-engine-learning-agents-5-4/4JPj/unreal-engine-learning-agents-intro-5-4>`_.

This project isn't here to compete with Unreal Learning Agentsâ€”it's meant to complement it. For those who find Unreal
Learning Agents more suited to their needs, I wholeheartedly encourage you to explore its capabilities. Both plugins
share the same vision: advancing AI in game engines and providing developers with innovative tools to build smarter,
more dynamic systems.

Acknowledgments
---------------

This plugin would not have been possible without the groundbreaking work of the Unity ML-Agents team. Their innovation
and dedication have inspired me deeply, and I am truly grateful for their contributions to the field. If you're new to
this space, I highly recommend exploring Unity ML-Agents to understand the full depth of what they've achieved.

Thank you for taking the time to check out this plugin, and I hope it helps you build amazing projects in Unreal
Engine!
