NOTICE: `ue-agents-envs`
========================

The `ue-agents-envs` package was adapted from Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit.
While significant modifications have been made to align with Unreal conventions,
we would like to acknowledge and give full credit to Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit team for their foundational work.

### Unreal ML-Agents Toolkit Modifications

- Adjustments to protobuf import definitions to align with Unreal conventions.
- Replacement of Unity references with Unreal for clarity and consistency.

### License and Credit

This project would not have been possible without Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit:
- [Unity ML Agents Repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

All credit for the foundational design, structure, and concepts goes to Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit team.
Thank you for your outstanding contributions to open-source AI research and development.
