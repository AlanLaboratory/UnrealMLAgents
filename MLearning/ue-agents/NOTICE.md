NOTICE: `ueagents`
===================

The `ueagents` package is derived from Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit.
While significant modifications have been made to adapt the codebase for Unreal Engine,
we would like to acknowledge and give full credit to Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit team for their foundational work.

### Unreal ML-Agents Toolkit Modifications

- Imports updated to use `ueagents_envs` instead of `mlagents_envs`.
- Adjustments were made to support Unreal Engine-specific workflows.
- Features like SideChannels, which are not yet supported, were removed.

### License and Credit

This project would not have been possible without Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit:
- [Unity ML Agents Repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

All credit for the foundational design, structure, and concepts goes to Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit team.
Thank you for your outstanding contributions to open-source AI research and development.
